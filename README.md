# objective

I want to use swagger to build openstack sdks for many languages supported by swagger client tools.

# structure

this repo has many folders, one folder is a component in openstack.

# wishes

hope many people contribute to this project, so that people will get many different languages sdks for your work around openstack rest api

#CI
this repo just holds swagger yaml files, which u can paste to swagger editor to get a gui to fetch your client sdk that you want, later on, when I get more money I will run a CI to eheck the syntax of swagger yaml.
